I am a strong believer that if you’re _interested_ in something, you’re _interesting_ to listen to. Too often have I
been chatting with someone who’s initially excited to talk about a niche topic or experience, but holds back with the
refrain “yeaaah you probably wouldn’t find it interesting…”. Au contraire! If you are someone who is genuinely
interested in the thing you are talking about and it comes across in how you’re saying it, I will find you interesting
even if it isn’t a hobby of mine.

- Excited to talk about the different gauges in model railways? Tell me more!
- Can’t help but talk about your love for journaling? Pray tell!
- Want to go in-depth about the ins and outs of cultivating a specific kind of plant? I want to hear it!

There’s something magical when someone is truly swept up in something that they’re excited about and it’s the sort of
thing that I want to be around as much as possible.

It makes me deeply sad to hear people diminish themselves and their interests, and I get sadder still when I realise
that it’s likely because they have previously had audiences that were less than supportive when they _have_ opened up in
the past.

If that’s you, I hope you find a community of people that truly, genuinely support you, whether because they’re
interested in the same topics or because they recognise that it matters to _you_.
