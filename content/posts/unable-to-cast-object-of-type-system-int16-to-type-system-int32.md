I ran into this corker of an error message recently which initially really confused me:

```plain text
Unable to cast object of type 'System.Int16' to type 'System.Int32â€™
```

If you know about data types and sizes youâ€™re probably thinking something similar to what I thought: why not? `Int16` is
_smaller_ than `Int32` and many languages will happily cast to a _larger_ version of a data type because there is no
risk of losing data/precision (unlike casting to a _smaller/less precise_ version which can change the underlying
value). Any value that can fit into an `Int16` can fit into an `Int32`!

{{< info "As a quick caveat, for all intents and purposes `Int16` is equivalent to short and `Int32` is equivalent to
int. Iâ€™ll be swapping between them where they each make the most sense." >}}

# The Problem

In my particular scenario I was trying to parse a `DataRow` with the (relatively lazy) approach of:

```csharp
var value = (int)inputRow["Value"];
```

Now, in my mind this was an easy (and previously very successful!) way to grab the value out in the type that I wanted,
and yet in this case it was falling over something terrible.

# The Reproduction

I tried a few approaches to figure out what was going wrong here. My first shot was to double check that you can
actually cast from an `Int16` (`short`) to an `Int32` (`int`):

```csharp
var inputValue = (short)16;
var castValue = (int)inputValue;
Console.WriteLine(castValue);
```

Aaaand... it works fine. Hmm.

Once it was clear that the act of casting from `short` to `int` is perfectly safe in and of itself, it was time to try
and find out what was different here.

As I mentioned, I wasnâ€™t just dealing directly with value types, I was attempting to cast the result of
`inputRow["Value"]`, so a true attempt at reproducing the issue is to try the same with a `DataTable`:

```csharp
using System.Data;

var dataTable = new DataTable();
dataTable.Columns.Add(new DataColumn("shortCol", typeof(short)));

var exampleRow = dataTable.NewRow();
exampleRow["shortCol"] = 16;

var parsedShort = (int)exampleRow["shortCol"];
Console.WriteLine(parsedShort);
```

And what do you know, we get
`System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.Int16' to type 'System.Int32'.` again!

So what is the `DataTable` doing that weâ€™re not handling properly?

The first question is "what does `DataTable` return if you donâ€™t try to cast it?" and the answer to that is "an
`object`"! With this information we can take our original attempt at a minimal repro and get it down to only four lines:

```csharp
var shortValue = (short)16;
var shortValueAsObject = (object)shortValue;
var intValue = (int)shortValueAsObject;
Console.WriteLine(intValue);
```

We see the error again which is helpful, but what is actually going on here?

# The Explanation

The answer is... [boxing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing)!
But not, like, ðŸ¥Š, more like ðŸ“¦.

Since weâ€™re working on a boxed value the `(int)` statement before the expression is an unboxing operation. If we take a
look at the documentation, we see the following:
> For the unboxing of value types to succeed at run time, the item being unboxed must be a reference to an object that
> was previously created by boxing an instance of that value type.
> [Boxing and Unboxing (C# Programming Guide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing#unboxing)

Since an `Int16` isnâ€™t the same as an `Int32`, the unboxing operation fails!

What we were doing before when we were changing a `short` value type to an `int` was actually
a [cast expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-cast#cast-expression),
not an unboxing. Although they both use the same syntax and are broadly similar in what they do, theyâ€™re different
enough that their behaviour in this scenario diverges.

This is why you could take the minimal repro from before and change the third line as such

```csharp
var intValue = (int)(short)shortValueAsObject;
```

and it now works; `shortValueAsObject` is first unboxed back into a `short` value type (which is the same as how it was
boxed and therefore succeeds) and the resulting `short` is then _cast_ to an `int`.
The Solution

If youâ€™re looking to fix the issue I probably wouldnâ€™t recommend the chained boxing â†’ casting approach; itâ€™s
unnecessary! There are a couple of ways to fix the issue in a much easier and cleaner way:

## Unbox to the correct type

Simple enough, just change the type that youâ€™re unboxing to! In the above example that means accurately reflecting the
fact that youâ€™re storing and retrieving a `short` rather than trying to jam it into an `int` straight out of the box
(terrible pun _absolutely_ intended).

## Use `Convert`

If youâ€™re adamant that you need an `int` (or whatever other type) even though it was originally boxed from a `short` you
can do so in a single step using `Convert.ToInt32` (or one of the other functions depending on your target type)! As the
name suggests, this function takes an `object` and attempts to convert it to an `int`, throwing an exception if it fails
to do so.

The one thing to note about this approach though is that `Convert.ToInt32` is quite flexible in ways you might not
expect. For example if you pass in certain types (like a `double` or `decimal`) youâ€™ll have a successful conversion, but
may lose data. For example, the result of

```csharp
var intValue = Convert.ToInt32((object)12.8);
```

is that `intValue` now has the value `13` stored in it! Make sure that you _know_ that the type being boxed is one that
wonâ€™t lead to losing information.

# The Summary

And thatâ€™s it! This was a fun post to write; I originally came across this issue months ago but hadnâ€™t gotten around to
writing it up, but when I did I realised that although I had indeed fixed the issue I hadnâ€™t fully grasped what exactly
was causing it to fail! I knew about boxing/unboxing and casting separately but Iâ€™d never really considered that they
use the same syntax while having different behaviour in similar circumstances.
